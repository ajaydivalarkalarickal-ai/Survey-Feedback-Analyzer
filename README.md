Project Title: Survey Feedback Analyzer
Problem Statement:
In any data-driven domain, especially in Data Science, analyzing textual feedback is a critical step for
extracting insights, improving services, and understanding user sentiment. This project aims to help you
apply core Python programming concepts to build a text-based feedback analysis tool. You will work with
survey feedback entries stored in a dictionary of lists, perform basic data cleaning, extract meaningful
insights, and apply logic using loops, conditionals, string operations, and user-defined functions.
Project Steps and Objectives:
📥 Step 1: Preloaded Feedbacks (Given Data) (1 mark)
Start your program with the following dictionary of lists, preloaded with 10 feedbacks:
feedback_data = {
'S_No': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
'Name': ['Ravi', 'Meera', 'Sam', 'Anu', 'Raj', 'Divya', 'Arjun', 'Kiran', 'Leela', 'Nisha'],
'Feedback': [
' Very GOOD Service!!!',
'poor support, not happy ',
'GREAT experience! will come again.',
'okay okay...',
' not BAD',
'Excellent care, excellent staff!',
'good food and good ambience!',
'Poor response and poor handling of issue',
'Satisfied. But could be better.',
'Good support... quick service.'
],
'Rating': [5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 4]
}

✍️ Step 2: Add More Feedbacks (4 marks)
● Ask the user to enter how many more feedbacks they want to add.
● For each feedback, collect the following inputs from the user:
○ Name
○ Written Feedback (text)
○ Rating (1–5)

● Automatically increment S_No starting from 11 onward.
● Append all new data into the feedback_data dictionary.

🧹 Step 3: Text Cleaning (4 marks)
Clean all feedback entries as follows:
● Remove punctuation (., ,, !, ?)
● Replace multiple spaces with a single space
● Remove leading and trailing spaces
● Convert all text to lowercase
💡 Tip: Use .replace(), .split() and ' '.join() creatively.

🔁 Step 4: Word Count Insights (4 marks)
Create a function count_word_in_feedbacks(word) that:
● Takes a word as input.
● Returns how many feedbacks contain that word (case-insensitive match).
Use this function to print:
● Number of feedbacks containing "good"
● Number of feedbacks containing "poor"
● Number of feedbacks containing "excellent"

📊 Step 5: Final Summary & Insights (12 marks)
● Display the final cleaned feedback_data (dictionary of lists).
● Print the average rating from all feedbacks.
● Find and display the feedback with the longest comment (in terms of word count).
● Print the list of unique words used across all feedbacks (avoid duplicates).
🧩 (Optional): Sort feedbacks by rating (highest to lowest) using zip() and sorted().
Display the sorted entries.
